Object-oriented programming, or OOP in short, gives you a particular methodology for implementing large and 
complex programming projects in a very simple manner. The methodology uses the structure of classes and objects, 
and four OOP principles, namely abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, to simplify the large 
programming projects.

All programming languages are not based on this OOP model of classes and objects, and some are known 
as procedural programming languages. But most of the modern general-purpose programming languages, 
such as C++, C#, Java, and Python, are object-oriented programming languages. 

`Benefits of Object Oriented Programming :`
1. The most important benefit of an object-oriented approach is that you tend to build any project in a more 
organised manner, making the development process very efficient.
2. The second benefit is that an object-oriented approach helps you implement real-world scenarios very 
naturally.
3. The third benefit is that the modification and updation of each independent module is easier in this case.
All of these benefits are the requirements of a good software development methodology; and through this module, 
you will see how all these requirements are met well by an object-oriented programming approach
